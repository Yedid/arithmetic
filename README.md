This repo contains code for our paper 'Visual Learning of Arithmetic Operations', Y. Hoshen and S. Peleg, AAAI'16, Phoenix, Feb 2016.

The paper can be found at: http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~peleg/papers/AAAI16-Arithmetic.pdf

The code depends on keras, h5py, numpy and PIL. The visualization in test.py requires matplotlib.

The code can be run without a GPU (although it helps). The network takes about 30 minutes to train on my laptop's CPU. 

Thr current configuration is for visual addition of 7 digit numbers. But all the other decimal operations presented in the paper can be tested with minor modifcations.

Running the code  

Prepare the dataset  
$ python get_data.py  
Train the network  
$ python train.py  
Show the network in action  
$ python test.py
